    "On July 21, 2017, the New York Times updated an opinion article called [Trump's Lies](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/23/opinion/trumps-lies.html), detailing every public lie the President has told since taking office. Because this is a newspaper, the information was (of course) published as a block of text. This is a great format for human consumption, but it can't easily be understood by a computer. **In this tutorial, we'll extract the President's lies from the New York Times article and store them in a structured dataset.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a common scenario: You find a web page that contains data you want to analyze, but it's not presented in a format that you can easily download and read into your favorite data analysis tool. You might imagine manually copying and pasting the data into a spreadsheet, but in most cases, that is way too time consuming. A technique called **web scraping** is a useful way to automate this process.\n",

    "3. The writer's brief explanation of why it was a lie.\n",
    "4. The URL of an article that substantiates the claim that it was a lie.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, those fields have different formatting, which is consistent throughout the article: the date is bold red text, the lie is \"regular\" text, the explanation is gray italics text, and the URL is linked from the gray italics text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why does the formatting matter?** Because it's very likely that the code underlying the web page \"tags\" those fields differently, and we can take advantage of that pattern when scraping the page. Let's take a look at the source code, known as HTML:"

    "- Web scraping works best with **static, well-structured web pages**. Dynamic or interactive content on a web page is often not accessible through the HTML source, which makes scraping it much harder!\n",
    "- Web scraping is a \"fragile\" approach for building a dataset. The HTML on a page you are scraping can **change at any time**, which may cause your scraper to stop working.\n",
    "- If you can **download the data** you need from a website, or if the website provides an **API with data access**, those approaches are preferable to scraping since they are easier to implement and less likely to break.\n",
    "- If you are **scraping a lot of pages** from the same website (in rapid succession), it's best to insert delays in your code so that you don't overwhelm the website with requests. If the website decides you are causing a problem, they can block your IP address (which may affect everyone in your building!)\n",
